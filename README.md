#SocialStyler
Style 4chan, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, and Imgur with the same beautiful Bootstrap 3 theme.

Basically, I don't like how Reddit and 4chan look, and I'm boring, so I figured "Why not make every social site similar?"

So that's what I'm doing, this will make 5 major social sites look similar by default, but you'll also be able to make sites look like 4chan, Imgur, or Facebook.

##How it looks
